**Image Similarity Search Using Different Approaches**
This project demonstrates multiple techniques for performing image similarity search, implemented using popular machine learning and computer vision methods. The objective is to compare and evaluate the performance of different approaches for similarity-based tasks like object recognition, duplicate detection, or content-based image retrieval.

**Approaches Implemented**
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Approach

Why CNN?: CNNs have become the backbone of most modern image recognition systems due to their powerful ability to extract hierarchical features from images.
What we did: We used a pretrained CNN model (e.g., VGG16 or ResNet) to extract feature vectors from images in the dataset. These features are then used for similarity comparison.
Steps:
Load a pretrained CNN model (VGG16 or ResNet) without the top layers (classification layers).
Pass the images through the CNN to extract feature embeddings.
Use cosine similarity to compare these feature embeddings and retrieve similar images.
Pros: CNNs are highly effective for learning and extracting deep image features.
Cons: Requires substantial computational power for training from scratch, but using pretrained models makes it much easier.
Autoencoder Approach

Why Autoencoders?: Autoencoders are unsupervised models that learn a compact representation of images by encoding them into a lower-dimensional space and reconstructing them back. These representations can be used for similarity search.
What we did:
We used a deep autoencoder architecture to learn a low-dimensional embedding of images.
The encoder part of the network generates compressed representations of the images.
These embeddings are then compared using a distance metric (like Euclidean or cosine similarity).
Pros: Autoencoders are great for dimensionality reduction, and the learned embeddings capture the essential features of the images.
Cons: Training autoencoders can be time-consuming, especially with large datasets. It also requires a good balance between reconstruction loss and meaningful embeddings.
Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) Approach

Why BoVW?: BoVW is a classical computer vision technique that represents images using local feature descriptors. These descriptors are clustered into visual words, and the frequency of these words in an image forms the image's feature vector.
What we did:
We used SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) to extract local keypoints and descriptors from images.
We clustered these descriptors using K-Means to form a vocabulary of visual words.
For each image, we created a histogram of visual words based on the keypoints' cluster assignments.
Finally, we used K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to find the most similar images based on their histograms.
Pros: BoVW is simple and interpretable. It can be computationally efficient for smaller datasets.
Cons: Performance is often lower than CNNs and autoencoders, especially on complex datasets. It requires feature extraction techniques like SIFT, which may be slower than modern deep learning methods.
